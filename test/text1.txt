By some curious chance one morning long ago in the 
quiet of the world, when there was less noise and more 
green, and the hobbits were still numerous and prosÂ¬ 
perous, and Bilbo Baggins was standing at his door after 
breakfast smoking an enormous long wooden pipe that 
reached nearly down to his woolly toes (neatly brushed) - 
Gandalf came by. Gandalf! If you had heard only a 
quarter of what I have heard about him, and I have only 
heard very little of all there is to hear, you would be 
prepared for any sort of remarkable tale. Tales and 
adventures sprouted up all over the place wherever he 
went, in the most extraordinary fashion. He had not been 
down that way under The Hill for ages and ages, not 
since his friend the Old Took died, in fact, and the 
hobbits had almost forgotten what he looked like. He 
had been away over The Hill and across The Water on 
businesses of his own since they were all small hobbit- 
boys and hobbit-girls.
